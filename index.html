										<h2>Hello, World!</h2>
										<p>This is the first of many steps taken to achieve software development mastery. I might have skipped this.<br />
										</a></p>
									</header>
									<p>I've been studying coding from a very young age but the first thing I worked on was trying to figure out how to make Donkey Kong 
										toss barrels to hit Mario. Most of my earlier attemps of video game development were self taught
										 and through this I learned a variety of languages such as C# and Java.</p>

									<p>My first foray into STEM was Electrical Engineering. I had a blast learning about circuits and renewable energy but ultimately decided it wasn't for me. 
										Fortunately, I had picked up my passion for Software Development! I went back to school and have recently graduated with my Bachelor's in Computer Science. Look out world!

									<h3>A Few Personal Projects</h3>
									<p>These are but a few of the projects I've dabbled in over the years. I like to come back to these whenever inspiration strikes to add new features. Most of these I started because I wanted to learn something new and working on a project seems to be the best way to do this.</p>
									<div class="features">
										<article>
											<a href="https://itch.io/jam/mini-jam-76-radiation/rate/966868" class="image"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></a>
											<div class="inner">
												<h4>Meltdown</h4>
												<p>You're a single worker managing an entire nuclear power plant. Will you have a meltdown before the reactor? Submitted for Mini Jam 76. Written with C# in Unity.</p>

										</article>

											<div class="inner">
												<h4>Personal blog</h4>
												<p>This project will serve a double function. One is to have a space for my ramblings regarding latest and greatest tech developments. Another is a space to practice web development skills. Would like to make this something greater. Time will tell! </p>

												<h4>Amazon Bot</h4>
												<p>I didn't trust the Amazon notification system so I wrote myself a little bot that would check stock levels and price. Doesn't work currently since Amazon has upped their bot detection game but would like to revisit this.</p>
